### Running the Notebook
Once you have pulled the repo down locally via git and have Docker installed all code here can be run fully in Docker based on a prebuilt environment by running:

`docker run -it -v <location of code>:/home/jovyan --rm -p 8888:8888 pangeo/pangeo-notebook:2021.05.15 jupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0`

This will launch a Jupyter Lab instance that can run everything for you. This can also be easily done in the cloud if you have a cloud environment that can be launched with a Docker image.

## Plain Language Summary of this Work

Frontal eddies are spinning masses of water (~30km in diameter) that move along western boundary currents like the Gulf Stream. When they form they carry productive coastal water into the Gulf Stream and drive upwelling within their cores. Together this leads to an increase in the amount of phytoplankton within them - much higher compared to surrounding nutrient-limited Gulf Stream water. On the east coast of the United States one common area of frontal eddy formation is just off Charleston, SC. Eddies then travel up the coast and dissipate near Cape Hatteras, NC. In this work we measured a wide range of physical and biological properties of a frontal eddy just north of Cape Hatteras. We compared these properties within the eddy to the coastal water on one side and the Gulf Stream water on the other, finding clear differences in phytoplankton community composition and other physical and chemical properties. Using the results of these observations together with previous studies we share a simple model for how frontal eddies may impact phytoplankton, zooplankton, and fish – hypothesizing that they may contribute to the high diversity and density of top predators off Cape Hatteras.

### The key points of this work are:
- In-depth investigation of a frontal eddy in the Gulf Stream off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina
- Continued physical and biogeochemical differences are observed between the eddy and adjacent water masses even as it begins to shear apart
- A conceptual model is developed for the ecological impact of frontal eddies along with the hypothesis that they could supply zooplankton to secondary consumers
